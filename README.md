Created for Unitec Institute of Technology - Bachelor of Graphic Design and Animation. Main idea is to get Building One to participate and encourage collaboration by submitting their response to a topic. I want this to act as a social network, but how far it will serve as one depends on my ability on making ends meet in terms of coding.   Major base of the code is from Alex Garrett's (PHPAcademy founder) Image Upload tutorial. This isn't intended for copy pasting, as I agree with Alex's intentions on not releasing the source of his projects. This is to share with friends who intend on helping me with the problems that arise while developing.  Remember, I am no coder (though I do aspire to be one) and I couldn't have done it without the help of Alex Garrett and Pigophone.
