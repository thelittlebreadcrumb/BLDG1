Created for Unitec Institute of Technology - Bachelor of Graphic Design and Animation. <br>
Main idea is to get Building One to participate and encourage collaboration by submitting their response to a topic. I want this to act as a social network, but how far it will serve as one depends on my ability on making ends meet in terms of coding.   <br><br>Major base of the code is from Alex Garrett's (PHPAcademy founder) Image Upload tutorial. This isn't intended for copy pasting, as I agree with Alex's intentions on not releasing the source of his projects. This is to share with friends who intend on helping me with the problems that arise while developing.  <br><br>Remember, I am no coder (though I do aspire to be one) and I couldn't have done it without the help of Alex Garrett and Pigophone.
